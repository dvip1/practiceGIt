# practiceGit
I made this repository to practice git commands.

First of all fork the repository and then clone it to your local machine.

## Git Practice Tasks
Just make a plain html, no need to add any css or js. Just add a heading and a paragraph. Then add, commit and push the changes to the remote repository.
<br>
- Shaunak: Create a new branch called "feature-login" and add a login page to the project. Once done, push the changes to the remote repository.

- Jagruti: Create a new branch called "feature-signup" and add a signup page to the project. Once done, push the changes to the remote repository.

- Prasoon: Create a new branch called "feature-homepage" and add a homepage to the project. Once done, push the changes to the remote repository.

- Dhiraj: Create a new branch called "feature-profile" and add a profile page to the project. Once done, push the changes to the remote repository.

After each team member has completed their task, they can create a pull request to merge their changes into the main branch. This will allow them to practice collaborating and resolving merge conflicts.
